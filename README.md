# Geiger Counter Module
This is a fun little synthesizer module which generates decaying pulses of variable length based on a Geiger counter. Every ionising particle detected by the counter generates a pulse, meaning that this module can be used as a random event generator. Or, you could play it with anything slightly radioactive, like.. a banana!

The Geiger counter used for this project can be found (among other stores) [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001260288440.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.7cb84c4d6dqwrG).
Its documentation is linked to in this repository.

The small circuit shown in the schematic interfaces the Geiger counter with the sequencer. It powers the Geiger counter through a 5v regulator. The pulses generated by the counter are cleaned-up and inverted, and a decaying envelope generator was added. It's a small circuit which can easily be build on your protoboard of choice. An example is shown in the build photos.
